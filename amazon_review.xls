"My review is a little bit long(sorry!) but I have shared my genuine experience after 7 days of use, it will help you decide whether you want to have these or not:Review [Day 3] (read review on last day of return below this):I loved these airdopes, tested it's batteries after 5 days of use, there doesn't seem to be any problem till now (as most of the reviews had problem related to charging and battery backup.)I am a casual user, music listener and video watcher, so for me it is simply the best.I previously encountered electrical interference in latest launched earbuds which is not at all present in these.Also, the feel of having these in ears is really soft, I used them throughout the day and they were great.Now, bass is quite down in these, also with 8 mm driver it is not that good with low frequency sounds. But it's just a minor loss nothing serious.At 999/- It can assure you BoAt service for a year and also great Battery backup.Earbuds : 5:30 hrCase : 5 times chargedNot 42 hours but around 30-32 hours overall.Not fit to enjoy gaming for hardcore gamers but great for casual gaming.ENC is present but I would say it is very light or rather negligible.Range is 5-7 m (with walls in between.)I charged it @ 10% battery first time, but will try to charge @ 30% or above from now to increase charging cycles. I was confused when to charge them, but apparently it's better to charge them as soon as you don't need them to have a good battery life, also avoid going below 10%.Right now with so many variants out there I believe if you do have a need of earbuds for normal use, these are the best.And one more thing don't forget to check whether the airdopes come to you with plastic sealed box or not. If they are not sealed in plastic then there is high chance of these being a returned product, which may or may not be as good as the one right out of the factory product.[Day 7 with some problems resolved]#Prob 1:The sound abruptly reduced, what I was getting earlier at 40% volume level now became 100% volume level.Prob #2:Also, the pair is not connecting as it should i.e. on opening the caseNow I am deciding to return the product as it is the last day, but suddenly I remembered: The Troubleshooting manual, and tried the following:Solution#:Unpair from the Bluetooth and pair again (even reset it if you want but first unpair it.)Do this üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ and most probably the disconnecting one side bud or bad volume level will be reset and hopefully will become the same as when we received.Note: But there is this issue of it getting functioning faulty and that when I thoroughly took care of it, never dropped it, softly handled it, charged above 40% etc. So technically these airdopes are not perfected for long use, you may notice some misbehaviour from time to time, but most probably the problem can be reset. So do decide whether to purchase these or not knowing this!I hope it helps you, as I was finding this kind of review before purchase but there were none!This is purely based on my review after I was irritated with some ENC variants of Rs 1500-2000 range. Due to their ENC feature, I noticed electrical interference/buzzing noise.I am keeping it finally as it has at least no buzzing or irritating noise, comes from a known brand at a low budget.Update (After 3 months): This pair is still working fine. I have noticed the battery is not that better as it was initially but it is enough for 3-5 time charge (not from 0% but randomly after each use, generally from 30-50%). They will easily last you at least a day with the charging case in one charge. (Remember one day is the least, if you don't use it like crazy they can even last 2 days). I have noticed though for me using them for long does generate pain in ears (by long I mean for about 4-5 hours straight, I use them while studying to cutoff outside noises, which they perfectly do for me.) Hope it helps to share it's update over a period of use. I always look for such reviews but nobody writes so I thought let it be me onlyüòá!",4.0
I don't know what to say. I bought it a week ago and one of the airdopes not working. I have been saving money to buy it and now i realise it's not worth it..I feel like going in past and change my decision of buying it.. Isse accha toh sasta Wale Hain ...itne jaldi kharab toh nhi hote. Aise bhi zindagi kharab ho rakhi Hain....aadmi thoda apna mood thik karne ke liye ganaa sunega par yahan toh yeh kaam hi nhi kar raha ...bahut bura lagta hain... frustration hoti hain...Boat ka sirf naam bada hain aur darshan chota hain..Ab batao what to do with these airdopes?

"Honestly what else can you ask for in a tws at  Rs.999? I am honestly perplexed to see a lot of people rating something like this 3 stars. It has a USB C port which charges at 5V 2A,it connects to bluetooth super fast and not to mention it comes with a 1 year boat warranty. What else do you even want? Noise cancellation? Game mode? At 999? Come on. The plastic top snaps super hard owing to the great magnets in this case, which is why the case top feels flimsy at times. At medium/low sound I only drained around 20% of the battery in 1 and a half hours of playing music from spotify. Obstructions distort the earphones though but that is to be expected with all earphones. Coming to sound, the fact that it even outputs sound which is audible is good enough for me.  Passive noise cancellation works super well if you are playing music and walking on the street. You won't be hearing a lot of traffic. You are not making a mistake buying something like this at 999.",5.0
"Airdopes are amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è. I bought one airdopes of Boat. But I'm going to buy two more quantity of same airdope 141. Product is superb & I'm in love with this airdopes. I am using headphone of skull candy but sound what I get in this Boat airdope 141 is much better than skull candy's headphone üéß. Kindly buy this airdopes with blind eyes as this is fantastic product. Lots of people has posted negative reviews, kindly ignore them. I liked the design most. Due to it's amazing design, product will never fall from ears. It fits very well in ear, we can run, play while listening music in airdopes. I will suggest to buy it if you need a amazing airdopes.

"I am a programmer with a taste for music. I listen to music like 10 hours a day so I know what I'm talking about.Pros:1. Good bass not so great but could go for it if you're not a bass lover.2. Acceptable vocal levels on defaults (if you don't use equalizer).3. Treble is terrible (for real).4. Weight and size are excellent. Sometimes while I almost forget whether I am wearing my earphones because I used to wear over-the-head headphones and recently switched to TWS (spoiler alert: big mistake).5. Charging case is good. Standby time is acceptable at this price range.6. Playback time is as advertised, 6 hours on single charge at 60% volume. This is also acceptable considering the price. Most TWS which offer 6 hours playtime start at 2499/-.Cons:1. I was sleeping on my bed and it slipped right out of my ear. Same thing happened while I was running on a treadmill at the gym. Full disclosure, I was running at 18 kmph on the treadmill. So I'm gonna say not suitable for gym.2. No ANC (active noise cancellation). I guess that's a fair trade at the price range. They gave you 6 hours playback by taking away ANC which costs extra for manufacturing.3. Don't drive your motorcycle wearing these, they will fly away in a second and you won't even notice it. Luckily I did because there was no traffic when I was driving.Overall a good purchase for a casual music listener but not so much into calling. I have a strong feeling these earbuds were designed by an introvert who doesn't like to talk on phone.",1.0

"This Airdopes 141 is good for first time user. Simply I am going to describe by its Pros and Cons.. Because I am reviewing it after 3 days..Pros:*Case is small and compact, so it's handy to use..*Sound quality is awesome despite the size of 8mm driver size.*At 60-70 volume label you can use it for 5-5:30 hrs at single charge of earbuds..*Case can give you backup charge for 38-40 hrs back up which is very good in terms of price..*Instant connect after opening the lid of case..*Bass is too good, in High volume you can feel the vibration of your ears..*Type C charger is there so it's good.*Light weight, so you can use it for long time..*Touch response of Play/Pause, Answering calls, Google assistant/Siri is good..*Distance is just for 10-12 meters*Passive Noise Cancellation is there.* Battery back is awesome.Cons:*Opposite person can't hear your voice properly if you in call because of it's mic. It seems to other person, that you are far away from your phone..*Sometimes right one is stop working.*Can't connect two devices simultaneously.*Charger quality is not so good, the type C pin does not stick properly to the charging point of case.. Like cheap quality..*Touch response of Next/Previous is not so responsive..I bought this product at ‚Çπ 999/- and I received this product on 31st July, 2021 and I haven't charge the case till 4th August after daily use in moderate basis.

¬†In my opinion, NEVER BUY THESE FOR CALLS.I have bought 2 pairs on Amazon, and they are the worst thing out there on calls. For music, it is OK but not as loud as other reputed ones.The listener can hear everything near you, even 2, 3, or 10 meters away.My best recommendation would be to buy a separate headset if you're going to use these for calls.",1.0
Guys you must note this. When ever I play any video from gallery or YouTube. When I do backward oftenly it gets disconnected and gets reconnected. Not always but often.

"-- About Amazon --I am highly disappointed from Amazon..1. Packaging was worst.2. Box of the product was broken and bad in shape.3. Seals of the box were opened.4. Case of the buds had scratches on it.5. Got delivered used product.-- About the Buds --1. Sound is not crystal clear. Treble sounds bassy. Sound is not balanced. Very bad for acoustics.2. Bass is okayish but distortion is noticeable in bass. And it sounds really bad.3. Overall sound quality doesn't worth 1299 price. Even my Nu Republic type-c earphones had better sound.4. Touch is bad. Sometimes action gets delayed.5. Touch the left buds two times for previous track is just useless. I can't go to the previous song at all because of the delay in action. It just restarts the song and that is itself hard to do. For Next track it works well.6. Biggest problem is single tap. There should not have been any action on single tap. I always end up pausing the song even on adjusting the buds.7. Battery is great. Buds lasted 6hr on continuous music. Also, the ASAP charge works flawlessly.8. I haven't tried the call quality.-- Conclusion --I will not recommend it, trust me, you will be disappointed. It's bad! Sound is not sharp and clear. It doesn't feel like a stereo at all.Go with realme buds, my brother is using them. They are compact with really good sound and superb bass (no distortion) battery is okay too 4-5hr.I am gonna return the product because sound is just not acceptable to me also the product seems used.The only things in which these buds excells are-1. Battery backup2. Charging speed3. Connectivity4. Tight fitting",3.0

¬†First and foremost, it's a very cheap product, so it's impossible to expect a lot of high class features from this set. So don't keep your hopes high.I will not go on listing the pros and cons. However I will just give a short review.The sound quality is good, it has good volume and also good bass. The pairing is to the point and quick, so it is good in that respect. The battery is also good and lasts long with a single charge.The most important thing I don't like about this is the microphone. It doesn't have any kind of ANC. And moreover while in a call, even the smallest sounds get amplified to a great extent, which might be good when you're indoors in a quiet environment. However, even if your TV is running at a small volume, it will affect your calling, and the one on the other side might not hear your clearly. This is most irritating outdoors, when you recieve a call because it's most certain that no one can hear whatever you're saying because the noises of cars, vehicles, pedestrians gets amplified too much and your voice is barely audible. It's fine to listen to music while travelling and such, but it's not at all good for calls on the go.",2.0

"The earbuds look so pro and expensive. Feels good to touch too. Battery is okay. Insta Connection is good. But the Pairing sucks. It works as a monopod almost all the time. Both the earbuds fails to be synced with each other everytime. When it connects, it works for like 30 secs, after that one of the earbuds loses its connection and continue working as a monopod. The Bluetooth connectivity is so bad. The connection gets interfered after u walk like 5 or 6 feet from the connected device. Overall I'll say it's worth like 799 INR and that's just for the build quality. You can choose to buy this one if you like carrying the connected device all the time in your pocket.",2.0

¬†Sounds:- amazing kind of sound which is truly noise isolating, Bass is literally bombastic but in terms of vocal it performs poorBattery:- I can assure you you'll never be disappointed with its battery performance you can use it as much you want in-ear running performance is more than 3-4 hours in case it lasts more than 3 daysTouch:- it is the main problem that you're gonna face with these earphones since they can be operated with a single touch so most of the time it stops without your will. Which is really problematic for those who listen to music while laying in bed.Connectivity:- well it has many disconnection issues sometimes the left runs while the right stops sometimes the right one works while the left one stops!! It's the problem you're definitely going to facePrice:- when it comes to price air dopes are the Ace of this segment for what it offersBut still that single touch use system is problematic!!All you can do is just go for it!! For daily use and those of you who listens to music while laying in bed may avoid it for single touch system",4.0
Don't even think of buying it's made of bad plastic the kids who loose thier things these are suitable for them as it's cheap after keeping on my ears for 5 mins my ears started paining I had got 2 returned it within 6 hours of delivery thanks to amazon who took it back and refunded my money.

"Pros:1)Call clarity over earphones is mind-boggling, to say the least. If you are someone who spends hours on calls (business and/or personal), I can blindly recommend this to you right away, no qns asked.2)Well and truly handsfree, no *bands* attachedCons:1)Uncomfortable, esp in case of prolonged usage.2)Touch controls are a hit/miss. Often end up irritating you.3)Though music is a personal preference and choices vary from person to person, I truly believe this headset is not for music lovers.",3.0

"Product is cheap in quality and also looks.There are some good points and many bad point.Good things are:1.it is budget range wireless earphones thats it.Bad points :1. There is some noise coming every few minutes. I dont know what it is.2. Connectivity : very poor. If kept idle outside of the box without using it , it gets disconnected and for connecting you will have to put earphones back in the box and take out. Thats d only way it gets connected. I dont know if thats what the right technique or not. But its annoying. And also either left or right keep gets disconnected anytime and again same procedure for that earphones.3. Sound quality: definitely not good. But if u want in budget range then its okay but again that sound i mentioned earlier is disturbing a lot.4. Main problem of the device is its touch sensor. When you adjust your earphone once it becomes loose in the ear. The song gets pause. Sensor touch control is good though it is again annoying that you will have to adkust or remove the earphones carefully else video or audio keeps getting paused or played.5. Buid quality: poor plastic box and earphone rubber and all quality wise its poor.6. Noise cancellation: beast mode makes no difference. Voice call also is not great. No significant difference or i may say poor voice call quality with noise cancellation.So summary is : i dont think it will last long may be not more than 6 months. Lets see.",1.0

"Battery life on single charge says 6 hours on Amazon and it says 3 hours on Boat Website. This means that when battery life is mentioned, it is probably mentioned for single ear usage which is very unfair. So, for 3 hours that the website says, I get 45 to 75 minutes maximum. If your calls are lasting much longer than this, please look elsewhere. Every meeting I have it is so embarrassing to change the headset in the middle of the meeting saying charge is out.

"This is not a review for the sake of it, I'm writing this after using these for more than 2 weeks. I'll break the review down in points:‚Ä¢ value for money: yes. This is absolute value for money, obviously not the best product but prolly the best product at this price.‚Ä¢sound quality: these are loud enough. Highs don't crack, mids are perfect, lows are clear enough. The bass is not exceptional but it's good enough, you won't be disappointed.‚Ä¢ ergonomics: they're lightweight and that's good. They fit quite well, not perfect but that also depends on your ears, they provide additional moldings of different sizes so fit shall not be a problem for most people.One thing that's appreciable is the touch control, it's just so good to have it because pressing buttons would otherwise have only irritated your ears.‚Ä¢The carry/charging case: It's good enough, I wish it had more resistance in the lid, the lid has become kinda loose with use but it won't accidentally open up either.‚Ä¢Fast charging: that's a big deal, the earbuds get charged real quick.",4.0
"I will keep this short and simple. Kindly note that I am reviewing this 48hrs into the purchase...Pros:-----1. Easy connectivity across various devices (yes, it does work with MS Teams!2. Sound is decent considering the price-range. No WOW factor though.3. Lightweight (I used it for 6-7 hrs straight without any ear strain)4. Looks cool! :)5. Fast charging is great!Cons:------1. Battery drains fast. Even with full charge it dint last more than 4-5 hrs of continuous usage.2. Cant not connect/pair with multiple devices at the same time.",4.0

Poor call quality as voice was not heard on calls. The LED light of one earpod was not flashing like the other side pod. I returned the product on first day of delivery itself. i guess fake products are in bigtime in circulation on amazon. Please do quality checks ensuring fakes are not being circulated! Its high time we question ourselves as to why big brands are offering products at high discounts of 70 to 80% on original MRP of 3 to 5k range. Its better to buy electronics from local stores with seal of purity/originality at a higher price!,1.0

"I have seen a lot of negative reviews for these earbuds however, these are not bad at all. They are really cheap at 999 INR and the build quality has taken a hit, however, what matters is sound quality which is stellar for this price. I already own a lot of earbuds ranging from 999 to 10k and these for the price are great.The battery life though not as good as claimed however, 5 hours on the earbuds and close to 30-34 hours with the case is much better than the competition.I only have one gripe with these and that has to be the eartips, it's sort of an oval shape and you'll need to find proper seal so try all the different ear tips given in the box.",4.0
"Before I go into the review, let me be clear about my reason to buy. I basically wanted to try out the Truly Wireless earphones to see whether the fit into my lifestyle, that's why I went on to purchase this.Amazon as usual, prompt and proper delivery, and also a good packaging without any problem.The Case:The case is a bit large than what you anticipate after seeing the airpods which isn't a major issue. It can charge the Airdopes three times from 0 to 100. The hinge is bit flimsy but does the job right and the closing magnet is also sufficient. The hinge is addicting to play with though. :) The case doesn't have any physical button, just open it and it's ready to pair which can be irritating if you're just playing with it.The Earphones:Don't expect Seinheiser sound from a 1000 buck earphone, this is made clear. They sound below average but the volume is sufficient, the ear fit is snug and doesn't interfere if you sleep with it. The Earphones last about 3-4 hours continuous music or 5-6 hours if watching movie or YouTube on a single charge. The touch sensors are irritating but can live with it. Last don't ever buy it for attending calls. It doesn't do justice to it.Verdict: For 1000 rupees is it worth? Yes it is. Did it satisfy my entry of TWS in my lifestyle? Yes it did. Overall if you are one of a kind like me please go for it and you won't regret.And lastly it does give a premium feel if you wear it in public. xDThanks for reading my review.",4.0
"I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....CONS1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag,  voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .PROS-1. the sound quality and the bass are great .2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .",4.0

"Decent product. Fits comfortable in ears for long time. Environment noise cancellation works good. Sometimes there is a lag in getting connected to my iPad. One thing didn't like about it is the size of the case. It's light but way too big. It creates a mould when kept in pocket.Battery backup of 6 hours per charge is a myth. It can hardly last for 4 to 4.5 hours and not more than that.As my title says, you get what you pay for. It's a decent product for the price one. And better than comfort level of Airdopes 441",4.0
"The best feature about this earphones is IWP (Instant Wake and Pair) technology. Once you open the lid of the case, the earphones connect to the phone/device. Followed by battery backup.These are good for listening to Music or binging on Videos. Definitely suitable for Workout with  their IPX4 rating.Very very bad for calls. Even though there is passive noise cancellation by virtue of their fit, the Mic(s) are very sensitive to surrounding noise. Don't pick these if you want to use them for calls and you want to use them in a noisy environment.The LED indicators are not flashy - an additional aircraft that I like.Allover a steal deal for the price and the stated purpose.Hope this helps your purchase decision! üëç",4.0
"daily use product and writing this review after 3 days of use. Connectivity occurs instantaneously the issue occurs with continuity of the audio though. There are instances when the connectivity gets lots and a jitter of audio occurs.Audio output quality is comparatively less to the JBL RUN series that i previously used though both have same driver. The body looks very plastic and has a  matte finish which does not provide a premium look compared to the 181 model. Call quality and audio recording quality is pretty good.the bass is good ,still the audio delivery can be better. The battery life is actually pretty amazing, there is no to very minimum lag in audio.And this has zero noise cancellation. you can clearly hear what's happening around and the white noise that is around you, Overall a 3.5/5 would have been better if there was a better audio deliveryEdit : the mic seems to only work for call. Not for recording or video calling via snapcall and other social apps. Hardware Integration seems a Lil off.",3.0

"I am a big fan of Boat, i have used many of their wired and wireless devices for last 8 years and they are still my go to brand for earphones.This is my first ever earpodes and i love it.1. Audio is good as always but i have better experience from my Boat Roackers 261 wireless which still works fine other than small break on the wire after rough usage during gym, workout, long distance train and public transport for almost 3 years.2. No physical buttons , feather touch and hold for pause/ play/ next/previous/ voice assistant.Here i fee like the sensitivity is too high, i am more used to hard clicky buttons.3. Case is sturdy , i like that it closes itself when  tilted or hold upside down. Good job there by the designers.4. Super fast charging is real and they should mention the super fast pairing too haha5. can used mono also , that is any one of the earpodes can be turned off while other one can still stay on.i haven't used enough to comment on battery backup and noise cancellation but from my experience with Boat for many years,  iam sure they will perform good and  I am looking forward to it.just from first experience , its a awesome product.Boat understands our Indian market than anyone else. Its a best buy for the value.GO FOR IT#IAmAboAthead",4.0
"pro -:1.For 1200rs decent looking decent sounding earphone s2. Sound quality is similar as MI basic earphones which is good,base is also decent.3. Decent 3 - 4hrs battery life for earphones and can be charged like 4 or 5 times until battery of case runs out.4. Case only takes around 1 hrs to fully charge.Cons -:1.Not so good connectivity i dont know if its particular problem with my laptop or these earphones cause connectivity is very bad with my laptop (nitro 5).2.If you watch movies or series in very highly compressed or some complex audio format then it might not play audio smoothly (but it only happened once when i was watching a series episode in vlc media player my wired earphones played audio smoothly but these eardopes struggled but it could be the limitation of bluetooth as well).3.Dont buy these for gaming some time lag can be very very noticeable in audio and video and lag can increase if the rendered audio gets very complex like if processor has to process audio of enemy attack + teammate audio + background music + other music in game then lag would increase very much.4.Range is average but it could be particular to your device as well like some phones might have higher bluetooth coverage and some less.Although these are good earphones i would have given them 4.5stars as they are good wireless earphones in budget if you ignore some little cons but boat needs to update their connection sound and welcome music of these earphones.Before buying these i use to think that for comfort these are better than neckbands but actually neckbands are not that bad at all for the following reasons -:1. Neckbands dont have battery in earphones directly beside your ear due to which they are lighter in ear2. Although it may seem convenient to carry airdopes rather than neckband but in some cases not putting your hand in pocket to get the earphones from the box and directly having them hanging in your collar is nice and convenient.",4.0
Product is good. Had some issues with the right ear bud volume so asked for replacement. Amazon customer service is so pathetic that they are not providing any replacement which was promised. They want me to get refund and buy it at higher cost now. Each customer executive tell you different story and denies what earlier executive had promised. Leadership team is even more useless they denied that my return window was closed when the app was still showing it open. Amazon customer service is just there to make things even worst for you. They no longer support the resolutions email id which had better support.,1.0
"Reviewing this TWS approx. 4 months, and found these TWS pretty good at this price range.  The ear phones comes in rectangular charging case, which provides the charging to both the buds. The case is sturdy and solid built. The material is of plastic (glossy plastic) and looks premium quality. There are shining LEDs on the case which gives an indicator or charging left in the case / while charging they lit up in increasing gradient to show that the case is charging. When fully charged the case LEDs (4 leds) lits up continuously showing the case is fully charged.Sound quality - In nutshell very good and satisfactory, on the contrary, I have not expected such a good quality of sound from these entry level TWS. Its simply amazing . The bass is good, mids are nice and terrible is also good. Tried these earphones on every music and the output is satisfactory . I can rate the sound quality on scale of 7/10.  (there will always some lacuna or grey types but the are soo infinitesimally that it is out of scope to mention).Latency - Basically used for music and movies (not in games), in both worked great and no delay was observed.Charging time - approx. 2- 3 hrs.Longevity - working good at my point of review ! last 4 months been.Comfort - very light weight and comfortable. It fits good in ears and do not falls while walking or running.In all, its a good TWS for those who wanna enjoy music without nit-picking the earphones.",5.0

"Excellent product! Very happy with the purchase. Air-dopes comes as a pair for stereo sound, in a cute tiny box that acts as a charger, which can be charged via USB-C port, has tiny four white light indicators to display charge level. Box has a flip cover, opening of it slightly will show two tiny red lights (for charging), opening it still more will show tiny blinking of white lights to indicate connected state. Yes, connection is instantaneous the minute flip cover is opened. Each ear piece is independent with sound output and mic so it can be used with one piece (mono) or two piece (stereo) as preferred. Music is very clear, good bass, clear outside sound / noise isolation making music listening most pleasant. Voice calling is again perfect with clear sound capture (other side able to hear us clearly) and sound output (we are able hear the other side clearly). Overall Boat Air dope 141 is sure one of the best product in its price band. Great product. Thanks!Pros1. Very cute appearance, light weight2. Excellent sound quality with nice bass3. Mic with noise cancellation is great4. Each pod works independently with mic and sound output5. Ultra fast instantaneous connecting, immediately on opening the flip cover6. Easier charging with USB-C port7. Charge duration is pretty good for pod and with additional back in box, it last for hours8. Touch control is great, double touch on right pod to next song, left pod to previous9. Simple touch to play or pause or take call.9. Comes with USB-C short charging cable10. Great features, great price, great reputed customer support with replacement warrantyCons1. One main issue is the risk of losing it. Design is not sufficient to hold it in place.Update: 30 April 2022Loved the airdopes but unfortunately lost one of the airdope in a busy airport. One of the issue with the airdopes is the risk of losing it easily as it is tiny, no way it can be retained firmly in ear. Hope boat comes with an utility app (if not already) to provide alert if the airdope moves away from mobile beyond certain distance to ensure we are not losing it. Contacted boat for options to buy one of it separate, unfortunately was told that by policy they never allow us to buy one lost airdope. So even if lost anyone of the airdope or charger it is like losing the whole set. Hope Boat changes this policy allowing buying lost items separate and becomes still more customer friendly.Best is to go for the model Boat Airdopes 621, which has a better firm fit and also huge 150 hours backup time with charger (has display to show charge %).Overall an excellent product, great quality, great price.

"Editing my review after just 3 months of usage. Right side ear bud stopped working and unable to charge, inspite of following all factory resets. When contacted customer care for warranty multiple times, there is NO response. Its been my bad experience with earlier boAt products, that after some time usage either of bud DOESN't work. Bought this one, hoping that boAt would have improved their product and service. Poor customer service. Better go with other slightly higher priced brands.",1.0
"Writing review this review after using it this for 2 months. It is great device for watching movies because its bass is good and voices are great! BUT never a good choice for making calls.

Given the price tag, this device isn't justifying it telephone call quality, I am using wired ear-phones while making telephonic calls. Disappointed!",3.0
"Hello buyers,This is a request if you're purchasing this to use for calling purpose then i must say this is not the one to go for.. initially i thought may be a little bit of cancelation atleast it may have but its not actually. Even its very usefull if you wanted to use to gather any other noise surrounded by ur self.. i mean it catches all the other sounds like bus other persons who spokes to someone else just beside you, instead of your voice.The buds are like..once you insert into you ears it will stop all other outside sounds.. i mean if you won't play any song and you try to say something louder you may feel terrible.. it feels the same effect like you have closed your ears by some blocker.. you can't use this while riding bikes because of this reason.If you're at home and alone then its very good to use.. the sound quality is very nice this is the only best point of this..Battery life is very good. Quick change.For normal movies or songs at 100% volume its goes for 3 hr and Calling 1 hr.Look wise good..one thing the touch is not always responsive.This review is after one month use of this device.",3.0

"I had to replace it once because the mic in right one was non functional + sometimes it stayed paired even after being put in the case and lid closed.After replacement, I'm writing a review after 10 days use. I would like to mention that earlier I've used bluetooth neckbands- One plus bullet wireless z and Realme wireless 2 Neo.I've used boat wired earphones earlier and I'm not a huge fan of boat. I purchased these Boar Airdrops under influence of Shark Tank üòÇI thought boat may have improved their quality.Now I'm gonna say somethings that's gonna trigger most Indians. Their sense in music sucks. All we Indians care is about bass. That's because it's only bass that a simple fellow can understand from the boom-boom sound and differenciate from a 50‚Çπ roadside earphone. There are other things as vocals, treble including bass etc that's makes a good listening experience.Now since most people only understand bass and demand bass, all the brands have started selling bass edition. And the Indian earphone/headphone market now lacks a good balanced earphone.Now coming to Boat Airdrop after this rant üòÇ I will compare it to my previous bluetooth earphones (one plus bullet wireless z and realme buds 2 Neo)Pros üëçüèª*I got it for ‚Çπ999 so it's the best when price is concerned. Cheapest amongst all my earphones.*It's truly wireless so no wire mess at all.* Pairing is simple and fast.*Very good fit in my ear, lightweight and comfortable(this point differs from person to person and ear shape and size is diffrent)*Battery life is great.*Sound quality is decent compared to the price. Quality of sound has definately improved.*Noise cancelling does work but it's not that great.*Looks good in ears and feels premiumConsüëéüèª*Range is not good. You'll loose connection after 1 wall. My One plus had a range of upto 3 walls. Realme had Range of 2 walls.*This airdrop gets glitchy for a sec or two every now and then but it's not a major problem. Its manageable but annoying at times.*Doesn't pair sometimes. Have to close the lid of the case and reopen it. Sometimes also have to manually connect from phone's Bluetooth option.*The case gets scratches easily. I have the white varient as it looks the best. But for scratches black might be the better option.Conclusion:I would rank one plus bullet wireless z as 1st(not the bass edition) but it's the most expensive also. 2nd position goes to realme buds 2 Neo. Boat airdrop at 3rd position but what more to expect at ‚Çπ999. If price is a constrain go for boat airdrop. Its truly wireless but there's also this headache of not loosing any airdrop by mistake also you'll have to carry the case for safety which is not a case in neckband.

"I have been using this product not even a full day. But the experience of something hands free is quite surprising. I have actually come to love this product, because of the sleekness. I am using it out of the box without giving any charge till now, and when I started it was at around 80% and with about 9 hours of use without putting it in the box, the charge is at 70%. I think it is between 80 to 70, and my device actually is not accounting for any numbers other than the multiples of 10 (which is true).Pros:1. Sleek design2. Quite comfortable3. Audio Quality - Good (But I am not the person to be judge audio)4. Long Battery Life (Not tested to extreme)5. Instant Pairing when hinge is fully opened.6. Dual Device Pairing (Explained Later)7. Capacitive Touch Control (CTC) is quite cool.Cons:1. No Volume Control2. Noise Cancellation is questionable.3. The hinge to the case could be a little more sturdy to hold and not suddenly clap into the shut position.ABOUT DUAL PAIRING.Well automatically dual pairing does not work. However I connected on my laptop and it got itself paired for Voice & Music (i.e. Audio). So now if I go on my phone (using Android), and I click on the paired device settings for my Airdopes and toggle off Audio, and pair only for calls it does connect itself. Technically any number of devices can connect so long all their connecting channels and parameters are different (and unique to each other).Overall Rating:  4.8/5",5.0
Overall everything is top class but there are one thingwhich i encountered.Its catching the noise coming from a very distance and it is making hard for the other person on the phone to hear our voice.This is the first time I'm experiencing this issue with boat.Otherwise.. bota always rock..

"In my experience buying a bunch of wired earphones, entry audiophile IEMs and wireless buds and earphones, boAt has come to be one of the most reliable out of all brands at this price (< 2k).Sound quality is great. I don't feel like they're too distorted. They're tuned for punchy modern mainstream music but old songs sound fine at volume < 70%.Battery is great. I don't expect close to the advertised battery life while listening to songs or being in meetings, but listening to podcasts and stuff while doing other things at volumes that don't distract you do stretch the battery life of these things to quite a lot. Charging speeds are convenient as well.Shape and fitting is great. Overall, they're a good buy.",4.0
Please note that I ordered black colour 2 times and what I noticed is when in transist the tws case collided with the box and got with paint fade and scratches even after 2 times replace same issue so I decided it's the manufacturing style of the box that cause this paint fade finally gaved a try to white colour which came in a good shape thank god i can literally say black is very cheaper than white if you chose black over white it catches dust fingerprint and scratches visible easily but white looks very premium and. So happy finally please do note that add some cover or cushion to the case which makes it still in transist... coming back to the review the tws was worth every penny I don't use it for calls only for beast mode which is quite amazing and the bass is extraordinary worth the money. Buy a protective cover for the outer case which will make it more Premium and safer,5.0
"it‚Äôs an amazing product @ a pocket friendly prize. Sound quality is great, also very comfortable in the ear. I had earlier used bluetooth neck band which was not a good experience.

"Never ever buy anything from boat. Their headphones are cheap faulty china products..For the first 3 weeks, the earbuds worked good. I charged them and they were running with good sound quality. And then suddenly one day the left earbud went silent. I thought it must be out of charge. So I left both of them charging for a day. The left earbud still wasn't responding. I tried to manually switch it on with long touch as described in the manual but still it won't be on. By this time i started using only the right earbud and left the left one charging and two days after that it happened again on the right earbud - it stopped working too, dead silent. Left both of them charging for next 4/5 days, still neither of them were switching it on. Tried long touch as described in manual on both of them.

Sounds ok. Other end user complained about my audio being too noisy. So mic quality maybe not that good. the mic may not be picking up your voice from all the way up by the ear.Also there is not much control over this from the phone. Not much information in the phone apart from battery Percentage either. Cant know how much battery is left in the charging case.But just the fact that it is low delay and pairs easily and stays paired pretty well makes it a worth buy. Especially if the 42 hour playback holds up. I am using it one side at a time and it sounds clear and loud enough with a good seal in my ear.,4.0
"First of all, this is a battery beast. I'm using this from 5 oct and today is 12 oct. I did it full charge on 5 oct and from that day i haven't charge this till now and my daily usage is around 2.5 hours per day. And i want to tell you, this would not suppose to use with gaming if you r pro gamer because of high latency somtimes. And you will feel uncomfortable if you use it all day long. On full volume sound quality looses. Recommended to use with upto 80% sound will give better experience. But as consider to price this deal is amazing under 1000 INR. #boAtHead",3.0
The product box and everything are pretty decent they have packed a lot of things extra earmuffs charging cable manual warranty card all the documents are there plus they have a detailed QA leaflet alsoThe body of ear buds has a matte finish‚Ä¶ Looks pretty decent when it comes to the year birds themselves they are also of good quality but I am not impressed with the sound sound is okay-ishThe reason might be that they don‚Äôt have enough drivers to amp up the soundBut yeah given that this is only 1.4 K it‚Äôs a decent package,4.0
"Edit: It's great..Everything is ok sound, fast charging, bass, look, etc. But main problem is the design. Its shape is not conventional and thus very uncomfortable.  It starts hearting within 15-20 mins. I have been using earphones (wired) from last 15 years but never had such uncomfortable earphones. Even Rs 50 earphones are more comfortable than this. Not recommended.",5.0
"The headphone fits well, sound quality is good but the mic pickup is less than the average and sometime need to speak louder to get hear by the other person.The headphone box doesn't works well, 1. When you insert the headphones into the box, one of the headset remain not charging untill I push it again; 2. Even after you kept the headphones in the charging case, still it connected with the bluetooth. 3. It pick up many accidental touches on the headphone and keep on play/pause the music.Finally it is stupid on the perfection side and clever on the music part.",2.0
"After a week's usage, this is what I have found.1. After a full charge to the earsets, they last for 2 to 2.5 hours at a maximum which is a bit difficult if you attend continuous calls in a day.2. The base unit also seemed to give a full recharge of 5-6 times only and even if my numbers are conservative, they hardly match up to 42 hours as promised.On a full recharge of the set, You can use the airdopes 141 for 2 days comfortably(at a usage of 4-5 hours a day) and anything beyond that is bonus.Its still OK at this price and the design is quite sturdy and strong.",3.0
"It's short of expectations and quality standards (1) Sound quality is low, even after full volume many times other party voice is low (2) Battery life - not able to understand. I am using it from 10 am to 6 pm but have to charge it atleast once in between to safely use it. In few mins charge it will show 100%. Right side has better Battery life ten left side. Not sure if this is true with others. (3) recharge box cover is loose get open up by itself, so poor quality.About good (1) light weight (2) sleek design and fits properly",2.0

"The product is really appealing from outside . But it will really check your patience while using it.1. The battery is rubbish , it discharges from 100 to 50% in 1 hour even after charging it for 2 hours plus with super fast charger and other charger as well.2. The case cover led lights is not functioning to indicate how much is the battery left.3. Comfort wise it really amazing.4. Sound is good.5. Noida cancellation is not there.6. Swift pairing as briefed that you open the box and it will get connected is not functioning.I still believe it to be a technical glitch , had requested for a replacement . Let's see.",2.0
"These earpods seem like a great value for money, and thats where it all ends.sound quality is average with below par bass.call quality is poor since a few words get muffled and also the person barely can understand you.quality and battery life is definitely good.cant even return it. just a waste of money",2.0
"Hope this review will help you guys...So, I'll not talk about the features and specifications as they are already mentioned, I'm just sharing my experience with this product.1. Bass: If you're a bass lover or more into Doja cat type like I'm, you'll love the sound quality. The bass is that level amazing.2. Sound: If you're more into lyrical or you love to hear the lyrics loud with decent music, you'll have to compromise because when listening to this type of music, the lyrics somewhere sound muffled and not so loud.3. Comfort: At first even I was worried about the comfort level of this product because of it's unique build but that's not the case anyhow. They're so comfortable that you'll not feel anything in there (that's what she said).4. Battery: Again beast level battery backup by boat. Company claims 42hrs but sure you'll get around 40hrs.5. Build: The case build quality is up to the mark, it's tough and with it's matte finish you don't have to worry about finger prints or scratches. The main earbuds on the other hand are not that tough but still pretty good.6. Conclusion: If you're getting the 141 (enx+beast mode) around 1400 or less, go with this product blindly and don't trust those stupid Youtubers saying this is not that good. Basically they have been paid by the companies like Dizo and oppo to increase their sale. And if your budget is around 2k, you can search for something better.",5.0
I was using this device for the past 1 week. I had face many issues1. Sound quality is ok considering the price.2. While calling if any sort of noise came then you won't be audible to the other person.3. Charging case build quality is not up to the mark you will get scratches very easily.4. Major issue is the pods themselves are not well build its inner chip was clearly visible to me which is not good.,2.0
"I have been using the boat AirDopes for about 2 weeks now, extensively for meetings. Here is what i have to sayGood:1. Packaging is sleek. The case is really nice, and looks really modern.2. The overall sound quality is okay. I liked the bass - especially when you listen to EDM.3. Had no issues with pairing.4. Touch feature works very well.Not so good:1. In meetings, the audio output is garbled, especially if the speaker / presenter is in a large room. This does not happen with the boat rockers.2. The real big issue for me was ear pain after putting these on for longer calls. The casing around the ear pod is very hard and presses really hard on the region around the ear canal. I think, BOAT should do something about this.Overall, at this price point i think the product is just about okay. I had a very good run with BOAT rockers until the left speaker died. Tried this one on an experimental basis.",3.0
Am writing review after using 15days. wonderful product from boat. Extraordinary thing is Battery I fully charged on 8th May Today is 16 may still 75% of battery. Also quick charging.alwayd My airdope is connected with my phone except while sleep. I really wonder about the battery. Before I used boat rockers neck band. It was good with good spec. Airdope 141 was awesome product trust me thank me later,5.0
"Hi... True that boat happens to be the market leader but if we are keeping very high hopes on the quality, then let's accept the fact that it's just to fulfill the charm of having this type of gadgets.. Have used one plus in past and have used this in excess the communication during calls is 70% clear giving only 3 star on noise cancellation as this feature is something that boat needs to work upon..At the end, don't be ina hurry to buy this product for 1400,wait for some deals and can buy less than 999 INR",3.0

¬†Fits comfortable in ears for long time. Environment noise cancellation works good. Sometimes there is a lag in getting connected to my iPad. One thing didn't like about it is the size of the case. It's light but way too big. It creates a mould when kept in pocket.Battery backup of 6 hours per charge is a myth. It can hardly last for 4 to 4.5 hours and not more than that.As my title says, you get what you pay for. It's a decent product for the price one. And better than comfort level of Airdopes 441",5.0
"I purchased 2 of these. One for me and one for my friend.Pros : sound, bass, voice while calling, touch all of these things are goodCons : when i tried to use these airdopes then it hurts my ear ( same issue with my friend) due to its big black hard oval structure so i returned this product because its not comfortable. I would suggest your to first try these form your friends (if they have) and only buy if it fits in your ears.",3.0

"When using both airdopes ( stereo mode ) the sound quality,noise cancellation  and bass everything good. If using single airdope ( mono mode ) it works in 80 percent volume for normal hearing. Sound output must be still greater by default. For attending  calls cent percent volume required. Further in single airdope use,if disconnects, doesnot reconnect automatically. It is to be reset. This lacuna should be improved by default auto reconnection.",4.0
"I would suggest anyone who is thinking about buying boat airdopes 141 to reconsider their choice. It sure is a decent earphone. But the call quality sucks. Mine showed different kinds of issues after the initial 3 months of use. Now I simply don't use them at all. It's just another waste of money. If you are seriously considering a tws. Go for something above the 3000 rupees mark at the very least. And if you don't have that budget, simply go for a neckband alternative.",2.0
"The airdopes were good for listening to music. For calling, the persons on other side of my call could not hear me properly, so can't use these airdopes for calling. Was much disappointed with this as I don't have habit of calling using phone at my ear.To add to my disappointment, one airdope stopped working after around 1 month of purchase, but started working again when I reconnected this.Now, again after 15 days, the airdopes have stopped getting charged, the case is charging and white LED lights are blinking on the case, but the airdopes ate not charging and the battery% is showing 10% on my laptop/ mobile.Moreover the airdopes are not getting powered on automatically, every time i have to press the touch space for 8 seconds to get it started.Now because of no battery, the airdopes have stopped working altogether.Have claimed warranty today, will edit this review again after response from the team.",1.0
"It is sturdy & has good overall sound quality. OK bass for this price. Good battery backup of 4-5 hours with moderate volume playback. My only trouble is with the ultra sensitive touch areas which can cause change of tracks when you least need it. Also the sound notifications are kind of weird - if you tap 3 times on any of the touch areas, a loud manly voice will shout ""BEAST MODE!!!"" to give you a shock - but when it is getting connected to any mobile or laptop, it gives a feeble ""peep"" noise as if the battery is going to die now!",4.0
"Very disappointed. üòëFriends, Don't waste your money behind this boat earphone. Totally waste of money.

"I like the Boat products, and have purchased many of its products earlier.I ordered Boat Airdopes 141, I got it at a good price of 999, and was happy to receive an early delivery.Everything was good, except during the calls, the person on the other end was not able to hear the voice clearly. This problem was with the right ear piece.I asked for an exchange, and Amazon promptly replaced with another set. On inspection the second set appeared to have been used one. I tried it anyway. It had a same problem, but with the left ear piece.I returned the item and got a refund. Would have been happy if both the earpiece had worked together",1.0

"Very bass heavy earphones. To the point of muddying out all the other detail in songs. Woeful in call reception, be prepared to yell to be heard.The worst bit is the battery life. Starts out at 2-3 hours and drops to 40 minutes after using it 10-15 times.I think this product should be inserted into the e-waste category. When the battery drops below 20%, it chimes every minute and badgers you enough for you to feel like removing and throwing them in a river. Exactly what I did.",1.0
Actually one of the ear bud started causing problems after 10 days. It stayed on even after being placed inside the case...Being On it causes the battery drain without even using them.Replacement period was over so I had to get it replaced directly from Boat Service Center.New one is working nice so far... I don't know maybe the one I received before was faulty or something.Current one is going nice as of now...You can go for some other product rather than this one as per my opinion...,3.0

"The headphone gets discontented automatically. I have replaced the first one for the same reason, but the second one started to shutdown automatically after a 3-4 week.

But it can barely run 2 h at a stretch.The sound quality of the item is fine, and I don't have an issue with it. But it has no noise cancellation for sure.

¬†This product is very good. The sound quality is very clear and awesome. Just that it doesn't have that good bass. Noise cancellation is good but could be better. I tried to play games with it, I played Minecraft and GTA 5, the sound was awesome. I would recommend this to everyone whose budget is under 1500. I just regret that I didn't choose the white color but this color is also good. Built quality is very good and it comes with a matt finish. The magnets in the hinges are superb.

"Best TWS I have ever seenPros: I have used rockerz 205 pro, 255 pro + and 255 Neo.This one have 8 mm drivers that's what I thought while buying but it's obviously equal to boat rockerz 205 and it even gives more sound at maximum volume than 205, 255+ where they are 10 mm drivers. Bass is same to same!!!And 255 Neo have 12 mm drives who's bass is decent below medium, and sound quality is ultra clear.As my observation I found tha in boat products lower the drivers size higher the bass and lower the loudness in middle volume but at full volume same to sameAnd only buy headphones from ApparioThen only it's east for best packaging and return and product quality.....",5.0
"I have been using them for a few weeks now, good enough for a good experience.Although I found them decent and fit quite nicely. I am not too impressed with a few things1. The ear plugs would go silent all of a sudden.. sometime one or sometime the other or both. U need to pair them again or just put in the case and take them out2. Not a good bass, Its normal, if u like bass these might not be for you3. Not sure about noise cancellation as always used it in a closed room",2.0

"The sound quality of the earphones are good enough, treble and bass are balanced.However the touch controls are really inconvenient and unnecessary. You try to put on your earphones, due to touch music player starts playing. Maybe you want to push your earphones a bit deeper? Guess what, now Google assistant will pop up. Watching a movie? Enjoying it? Maybe want to lie down on your arm a bit now? Oh sorry, touch activated again, now Google assistant will pop up first and then the earbud will switch off.Such technology was really not necessary, a simple button could have been both functional and convenient. Oh and the touch won't even work properly when you want to use them for rewinding the song(the double tap)So from the inconvenience pov, i would really never ever recommend these earphones. There are much better ones.",2.0
"These deliver a good battery life up to 4 days with moderate usage .But sound quality is not up to the mark, bass on these is of mid level from 40Hz to 80Hz on an equaliser so you will not get that warm 20Hz- bass that everyone wants .Its for watching videos or listen to voice as it falls just under its range but MUSIC? i think not. The description (on website) says it has a range upto 22khz i assure you it is not .",3.0
"Pros:The price is nice in the summer sale.The sound is good at even 15-20% volume.The color is good.Fitting is perfect .The case has a matt finish so, doesn't hold onto fingerprints.Cons:Beast mode isn't working. It switched on once and then could not get it back on even after powering off the buds. Though the touch controls are responding well.There are no volume controls. Any bud with a stem should have vol controls.Cyan color is only the ear tips. It should have been on the buds too.Airdopes 381 are available at the same discount price on Flipkart which are actually costlier than this one.",3.0
Battery is just over an hour when on calls. Starts disconnecting after 70-75 mins.Charging time is impressive. Within 5 mins shows good charge for any emergency calls if needed but overall on full charge runs for just an hour as against the product claims.Btw customer service numbers don't exist as given in amazon. Also amazon is unable to help in case of boat. So be cautious buying boat products from amazon.,2.0
"Highly diappointed by the battery of the airdopes even though my volume is 40%-30% still they don't last for more than 4-5 hours, sound quality is decent for the price no, howy bass is not that punchy, at low volume bass is barely audible, comfort k bhi g**d mar rakhi hai 2 hours k baad kaan dard krne lgte hai, hold is good morning running or cycling krte hue use kiya h & they didn't fall , pr still I fear if they fall while cycling it would hard to find themChao!!",2.0

It happened for sometime half a minute to be exact and then got fixed.Sound quality is good",3.0
"The first impression wasn't good. The pairing was fairly simple and fast but the sound quality was disappointing. I thought I'd give it another try after giving it a full charge and it somehow changed my mind, but not entirely.This review is after a month of usage-1. Case battery back up started deteriorating.2. Sometimes even after I put the buds in the case and closed the lid, it'd still be connected to the Bluetooth and played whatever was played.3. The touch is either too sensitive or not responsive at all.4. Beast Mode alert is very loud. When the buds change to Beast Mode there's an audio that says 'Beast Mode' and it's so loud it hurts my ears.5. Sometimes it doesn't automatically connect to the Bluetooth. I have to do it manually.6. I treat the case with utmost care. It's always been in my bed only, never dropped it. But the lid has become a little flimsy after some opens and closes. It's not much but it doesn't feel good. Doesn't feel sturdy.7. Sound quality is okay 3.5/5. Noise cancellation 3.7/5. Call quality 3.5/5.Would I buy it again for 1200? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. The case's deteriorating battery back up is worrying.",3.0
"I haven't used earbuds before. boAt Airdopes 141 seemed to be nice and surely gives long battery life. Fits easily into the ears. What I didn't like was the touch controls. A light touch while trying to adjust, wear or remove the earbud activates the call disconnect or pause/play music. This is causing very inconvenience in using it. I would prefer a hard touch or button type control",4.0

I bought this after noticing fabulous reviews of this product. But I think I was delivered a faulty product so my review is impacted by my experience with internally damaged product. The return window has closed so I hav to live with this product unless Boat or Amazon's customer support team takes notice and replaces it with non damaged product. I had ordered it well in advance to gift it to my wife on my anniversary on 29.01.2022. So there was no way I could have checked it before 24th Jan (return deadline). May be my fault. The sound is so low that one can barely hear anything. Here I must admit that my experience with other boat product has so far been very good. I hope Boat team takes notice and supports me on replacing the damaged piece with new one.,1.0

"Hello, this is Ujwal! Let us get a deep dive into the review!So, I have been using the airdopes 141 for a good time of listening!I have analysed and found these pros & cons of the Boat Airdopes 141:(i) The main important thing is the battery backup!You can charge it for an hour and use it for a week if you are using for a few hours per day.(ii) Noise cancellation is good and the sound leakage is really less.(iii) The bass quality is fine in the domain of TWS earphones but if you compare to the headphones then you find the bass quality varies a lot!(iv) The sound quality is really good, you can enjoy your workout time or an evening walk with a clear sound in your ears!(v) The airdopes look really stunning when plugged in our ears and the airdopes box is really good to carry on anywhere we want!So, this is the detailed review of the airdopes 141. If you are looking for a TWS earphones in this range then you can definitely choose Boat Airdopes 141.",4.0
- Good passive noise cancellation- Good bass- sound quality is pretty decent- Call / voice quality is below average (expected out of any TWS at this price range)- Left ear buds gets disconnected sometimes. But gets reconnected if we put it back in the case and reconnect- Battery discharge is not the same in left and right.I am actually quite happy with this purchase considering the price,4.0
It now shows 10% charge no matter how long I charge itSound is pathetic on calls no noice cancellation whatsoeverMusic and gaming was good but can't use it for more than one hour and now with the 10% it doesn't even last five minutesUnfortunately return window closed but honestly I'm never buying a BOAT audio device again,1.0
"My first boat product purchase and was utterly disappointed. Never seen such a cheap flimsy plasticky material at this price point. They are just buying cheap Chinese knockoffs and rebranding them as boat products. Useless crap company. Listed below are pros and cons.Pros:1. Battery backup is quite goodCons:1. Super cheap and flimsy build quality.2. Sound clarity pretty bad.3. Sound is bass driven and there is no treble.4. Volume needs to be much higher to get good bass.5. Call clarity is pathetic. You won‚Äôt be able to use it for meetings or calls.6. Return policy for the product. Guys be informed that Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide refund option if you don‚Äôt like and return. You will only get the option of replacement. I am nowstuck with this bakwas product.It‚Äôs better to go for known brands such as LG, Sony, JBL, Sennheiser etc with more budget.Will never buy boat products again.",2.0

¬†Hey guys ! I am Manik. I am giving you my honest review about this product. It's been 1 month of this product since I have purchased it. Trust me it is totally worth it if you are planning to buy a best sound quality Bluetooth. It's sound is premium. Looks are amazing. Battery life is just wow ! I am giving it 4 star just because of its exterior built quality, it is not so good and you will find many scratches after purchasing it. Thanks .",4.0
Cons : Battery backup is not good. No way near to upto 42 hour claim. It hardly runs for 4-6 hours .The material and design of case is not standard.Buds sometime don't charge even when it is in case.Noise cancellation is not there.Pros :In ear fitting of buds is very good.Touch works perfectly.It connects to device easily once case is opened.Case charging is fast. (Bud charging is also fast but it doesn't run for long),3.0
"I recieved my airdopes and after using it for one hour, the sound flactuates. While listening to music, the sounds stops for a fraction of a second on both sides of the device making it hard to use. I don't play games (mobile games...ptffff), just music and calls. I restarted my phone, did a reset of the airdopes, reconnected to my phone but the problem still persists. I have made a request for exchange, let's wait and see if the other one has the same issue. Sound quality is good, but the device i recieved is defective.",1.0
"- These airdopes look good but are not good for the ears. The suction/pressure produced by the silicon of the airdopes while inserting it in your ears hurts a lot. There is a chance to damage your eardrum because of the pressure produced.- The sound quality is okish.- No bass- While on call, lot of background noise is recorded and sent via microphone- Cheap plastic case in which they are held magnetically. Airdopes will scatter if the case containing them is dropped from 0.8m height while it's closed.",1.0
"The build quality is good. The sound quality is average. Beast mode works fine, it reduces the latency.Battery backup is good. 4-5 hrs of usage in single go.And 24 hrs of usage overall with case. Buds recharges very fast from the case.This is my second TWS from Boat. Both started having charging issues from the case 3 months.TWS buds randomly do not charge in the case & gets connected to the device previously paired, even after the case is closed.I would suggest go with other TWS or try neckband.",3.0
I am using this for a week now. And iam satisfied by its sound quality and clarity. It has very louder and clear audio. If you're a bass person I wouldn't recommend this product. But at this price range i would say it gives the best features and quality. As in terms of comfort there is no pain for ears after continuously using for several hours straight. In terms of charging and battery capacity I would you get 30 to 35 hours playtime overall from charging with case and it has quick charge as mentioned which you get 75min playtime within 5 minutes of charging. It has enough bass but not overkilled bass. Overall I liked this product.,4.0

¬†1. As soon as open the case it connects.2. Easy connectivity3. Good touch control4. You can use either two buds or one bud.5. Deep bass and good music quality.6. Good battery backup upto 40-48hrs.",4.0
@999 the best u can get...u will not regret this purchase..compare with any other...Boat 255 pro plus was also at 999..but i returned that.This one is having the best sound quality...255 pro plus has better range compare to this one...bt who care...7m and 4m ..all the same fr me,5.0
Still working as charm. Charges very fast. Works very very long. I saw the whole puspa movie and it was only 20% drained. The strength and durability is also good. Dropped it coupled of times but still no issues. The only issue is it might disconnect of there are huge barrier. But that wont be a big issue. I use it all day. Might cause a bit itching irritating feeling after long use of 3-4 hrs. But other than that I would really recommend this.,5.0
"It has been 10 days since i bought this product, it started showing problem , firstly noise cancellation is the worst (you can't use them outdoors) , calling quality is poor and sometime sound moves from one ear to other randomly ( its just annoying) .I gave it two Stars coz of the snuggly fit and touch control...",2.0
"I was very disappointed with these airdopes. The sound quality is average for music. But the microphone is very bad. So it's a waste of money for people who are looking for earphones for calling purpose. Also, the charging speed is hopeless.",2.0
"The sound quality is amazing 5/5 to that!! I have been using them for a month now.The Bass is decent 5/5 to them in this price range.Calling experience can be improved, would give 2/5 in that field.Connects rapidly so, connectivity 5/5.Design is good and are small so you can easily carry them in little space 5/5 to that!Overall they are amazing in this price range. I have used other brands too, but compared to them BoAt is better. So go for it.",5.0
"Very pathetic performance on calls. I think the mic is not up to the mark. Tried to connect with phone and PC, the other party did not hear me properly. Many times they only heard bits and pieces. Also the max volume is also not enough sometimes when on call.Listening to music on these headphones is really good. It‚Äôs a totally different experience than the calls.",2.0
"I have bought boat airdopes 141 2 months ago. Main usage for me has been participating video call.Pros:-- Lightweight- Decent sound quality and noise cancellationCons:-- Bad power distribution between left and right piece- Discharges way to quickly- Low quality mic- Bad quality bluetooth (Disconnects sometimes)In my case, the left earpiece looses power in around 1 hr, thus I am left with only one ear piece. The main problem with different discharging rates is, whenever the earpiece also acts as a mic, it discharges much quickly compared to the other ear piece.VERDICT - It can be value for money as an entry level wireless earphone, but it is not reliable if you want to use it for serious calls, as one ear piece might get shut down between your meets. Not recommended for serious use!",1.0
"I am posting this review after using the product for for almost 2 months and I must say initially I was very impressed by sound quality. Working excellently but from last 2 weeks I started facing some issues.(1) Sound Intensity has decreased, now it's not delivering intensity even at full volume which I can get at 50% volume initially.(2) There is nothing like Noise cancellation feature after just 2 months of usage.(3) Fingerprint sensor not that fast.(4) Bass is not up to the mark as it was initially.",3.0
"The boAt 141 is an absolute beast especially considering it's price range. I mean there are alot of exceptional things about these Earphones like the Sound quality is very Clear, the battery life and charging speed of both the Earphones and the Case is fantastic, all of that and more at a very affordable price for everyone.I do have a few complaints about these Earphones though such as the Volume of the Sound can vary from each time you connect and disconnect them for example sometimes I would only need to have my sound adjust to medium üîâ setting in order to hear everything clearly, but sometimes I would have to turn up the Volume to max üîä just to barely figure out the Audio(a simple solution to that is to just unpair and pair the earphones again, but that can become quite tedious sometimes). Secondly I love using these Earphones with my TV but most of the time the connection is too weak with it and so the audio can get a little distorted and that can take away from the experience of certain Media.I would also like to add that I went through and researched every boAt eardopes and these were always the best or slightly better in most of the aspects even compared to the more expensive variety of  boAt Eardopes.So in conclusion just go for it, you will not regret it(hopefully).",5.0
"I have been using this for a little above 2 months, the earbuds are super light weight, the case too. The case feels flimsy but it is sturdy enough, has survived being thrown a couple of times by a toddler. The case doesn't pick up dirt or scratches easily too, since it is matte finish no finger print smudges either.The fit has been okay for me, the tips are silicone but not the form fitting ones. Your mileage may vary. They do provide couple of other size tips too.Coming to the sound:The sound is decent for casual listening, watching movies on the mobile at night when the kids are sleeping, for music it is good enough, but these won't satisfy an audiophile.Battery life:Battery life has been great, 3-3.5 hours in the buds, and the charge in the case usually lasts me a week and I only need to charge a day a week for my usage.The price is too good to ignore for the convenience offered.",4.0
"The sound quality that boat is providing for this price is not at all good. The bass is no doubt great but the overall sound quality is not. There is no clairty present and you can hear a constant static noise whenever you are playing any media, in fact the static sound can only be heard while playing media, the static sound vanishes when you pause the music but resumes while playing, I'm guessing it has something to do with bluetooth but still something should have been done regarding this.Other than that, the ear-fitting is pretty good, it doesn't fall off how much ever you jump or run. Though remember that the airdopes get loose if you smile too widely while wearing them xDThe loudness is adequate as well. The noise cancellation is excellent, you can't hear a person talking beside you with these plugged in with volume at just 30%, so full marks for noise cancellation. The touch controls are decent.3/5 overall. This really isn't worth the money in terms of sound quality and that's what one looks for in a earphone, could have let it slip if the price was around 900-1000 rupees but for 1399 this isn't what I expected especially after reading so many great reviews.",3.0
Spending Rs 1499/- it is budget Oriental buds and keep hope that only. 1. Nice look 2. 75% ear hold capacity means not perfect fit..like above cost Rs.5000/- 3. 45% ok for call quality for indoor 4. 65% ok for songs quality. 5. 35% touch sensor working. So spend more money if you want good call quality and need good touch sensor.,2.0
"Its really amazing that an Indian brand is doing so good with their product. This Airdope 141 is rwlly good with battery performance, even sound compared to others in this price is fairly decentLevel is exactly same as Oneplus Buds Z but yeah obviously being half the price it does not matches rhe quality.Although the sound is pretty good with a nice bass also.Build quality is far better than expectations, only that the box cap seems to be very light so you have to be careful with that.Overall its good specially for people who want to have Tws to get rid of wired and neckband earphones.Good job Boatüëè",4.0
The product is a cheep product which cant sustain one month of opening and closing the hinge of the product is not even worth the value and during a small fall in a soft surface the hinge opens up and the ear bud flys off there is a lot of chances of loosing single ear piece.Demerit : Chances of losing a single ear piecebox quality is not goodChances of ear pain during prolonged usage of earpiece due to big ear piece which doesnt fit people with small earsMerit: Long battery life /decent sound quality not a big fan of the sound quality.,1.0
"Very very bad product....it looked like it's an amazing product at such amazing prices but it's is not. It's is very bad when you use it on a regular basis: 1. ears start paining after 3-4 hrs of use 2. Their is no noise cancellation neither for the listener nor for the receiver 3. If you think of buying this for call purpose then DON'T, it's useless...their will be hell lot of echo when u talk on call especially for the person on other side of call. In simple words you won't be able to talk on call with these dopes",1.0
"I am writing this review after using the product for about a month. Product finishing is quite good. Case is light weighed and handy. Good thing is that it has a good battery backup.Sound quality is pretty good and noise cancellation is amazing in this price segment. Honestly, in this price range you cannot expect anything premium but this product will not let you down. Don't expect quality of Sony/Apple Airpods or so in this price segment. Be fair and justifiable with your purchase and budget.Recommend!",4.0
Bought this item based on the product review ratings. unfortunately It is not close to rating it has got.Noise cancellation does not work- feedback from the people with whom I was speaking.Cons:it captures lots of background and other people's voice.Sound quality is also poor.Bluetooth connectivity is poor lots of hiccups during conversation.Pro- priceNot recommended for work.Unfortunately you can not return the product so choose wisely.,2.0
You can go for it if you‚Äôre on a budget and don‚Äôt wanna spend more than 3k. Some points I‚Äôd like to share.- The color is not as vibrant as shown in pictures. Is quite plain in person. (Expected)- The case can be reduced in size it also looks quite cheap.- Sound quality is good and I don‚Äôt think you can expect anything better at this price.- Connects quickly and is not much of an hassle.- The USB C cable provided is hilariously short.- You can‚Äôt  unbox it without ripping the box.,4.0
"UpdateI would like to appreciate the boat service. Although the return period was over it was still within one year warranty, so I claimed the warranty on the ear dopes and they replaced it within a few days. So thumbs up to the service team. Will update on quality of new product in a few months.Initial ReviewPoor quality airdopes, we had bought 2 sets one of 141 series and other 121 series, the right side stopped charging within one month for both air dopes. Don't buy it",2.0
"Now it's like 20 days I'm using this Airdopes 141 and I must say I'm not at all satisfied with the product, it has terrible Mic and sounds so bad it has some sort of connection issues it goes automatically off sometime gets disconnected automatically when you are on call battery drain so fast, the plastic built quality feels so cheap the case is oversized idk why. The overall experience with this product so very poor so guys save some more money and buy oneplus z or some other know brand. I know the rate is comparatively much cheaper and believe me guys the product is way much cheap in every aspects.",2.0
"Although it's not a great TWS, it's definitely one of the better ones at this price range. I've been using this for almost a month, quite heavily too, and so for I've been really impressed with its performance. I really like the sound quality, it's top notch for its price. Though its noise cancelation as well as beast mode are nothing to brag about, ""manageable"" is how I'd put it, not sure if it's synonymous with boat brand in general or just this particular product. The only thing that I didn't find amusing is playback time of buds, they barely last 3-4 hrs on average, in this case fast charging has turned out to be a life saver, although battery backup in case is quite impressive. Overall, it's perfect for thousand bucks.",4.0
